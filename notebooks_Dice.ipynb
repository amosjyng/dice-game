Otherwise, it's actually better to take the 1 on average (so our intuitions for distrusting the math sometimes was right)\n- Sometimes (but not always), it makes sense to even keep multiple 1's, even if you're still rolling afterwards\n- 4 is a good score to aim for when you have 4 or 5 players, but we had 8 players, so it's better to aim for 3 or even 2\n- There's a 2% chance of rolling all 3's, which is actually not that crazy low\n- Each spot down in turn order seems to confer an approximately 2% advantage, so the 5th player to take their turn after you has ~10% advantage on you, which explains why there's the rule that the winner is supposed to move first next round, to keep it even",
